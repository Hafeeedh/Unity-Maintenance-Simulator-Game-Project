# Unity-Maintenance-Simulator-Game-Project

## Project Overview

Hey everyone! So, for my Projet de Fin d'√âtude (PFE), I'm diving into the world of game development. I'm creating a Maintenance Simulator Game using Unity ‚Äì you know, the cool software that lets you make awesome games! üéÆ I'm also using Blender for 3D modeling because, well, we need some sleek vehicles for our game.

## Features

### Unity and Blender Integration

1. **UI, Settings, and Main Menu:**
   - Creating a super user-friendly menu where players can tweak settings and jump into the game. Gotta make it look cool with some animations!

2. **3D Modeling and Shading:**
   - Building detailed 3D models of vehicles and making them look fancy with textures and shading in Blender.

3. **Rendering Scene:**
   - Making sure everything looks smooth and realistic in the game. Lighting and shadows for that extra oomph!

### Visual Studio C# Development

4. **Light and Wiring Feedback:**
   - Giving players feedback on the lighting and wiring they're working on. We want it to feel real, you know?

5. **Wiring System Actions:**
   - Players can do things like connecting, disconnecting, and fixing wires. It's the heart of the maintenance game!

6. **Logic Gates for Wiring System:**
   - Adding some logic gates for those electrical circuits. Real engineering stuff!

7. **AR Foundation with QR Scanner:**
   - Augmented reality? Yep, we've got that! Also, a QR scanner for some tech-savvy interaction.

8. **Mode Switching:**
   - Letting players switch between different modes ‚Äì exploration, maintenance, diagnostics ‚Äì for a complete experience.

### Resources

9. **Database of Wiring Structures:**
   - Storing pre-made wiring structures for different vehicle systems. Players can also customize them. Flexibility, you know?

10. **Design Pattern for Vehicle Parts:**
    - Figuring out a smart way to manage all those vehicle parts in the game.

### Visual Studio Code (Node.js) Development

11. **WebApi Interface:**
    - Creating a WebApi interface for smooth communication between the game and external resources. Models, models, models!

12. **Analytics, Rating, Adv/Dis-Adv:**
    - Tracking player actions, getting them to rate the game, and throwing in some advantages and disadvantages for added excitement.

13. **Scenarios/Scene:**
    - Developing various scenarios and scenes for players to explore and fix. Scoring them based on their performance because we're keeping it competitive!

## Additional Considerations

- **Documentation:**
  - Gotta write down how everything works, so others can understand my genius! for my internship report

- **Testing:**
  - Playing the game over and over to find and fix those pesky bugs. It's like a treasure hunt but with errors.

- **Iterative Development:**
  - Making changes based on feedback from my buddies who playtest the game. Their opinions matter!

So, that's the plan. I'm stoked about this project and can't wait to see my Maintenance Simulator Game come to life! üöóüîßüïπÔ∏è
